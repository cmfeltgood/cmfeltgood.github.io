                    Hi, I'm Stephanie, inventor of <em>Silly Clock Time&trade;</em>, as well as the <em>Fork with Spinning Prongs&trade;</em> and the <em>Yoga Ball Door&trade;</em>.
                    I hope my inventions will inspire a generation to imbrace their stupidity. Who needs functionality when you have whacky ideas instead? Who cares if 
                    nobody will buy any of your inventions? Who cares if you are on the verge of declaring banktrupsy for the seventh time on your company that 
                    even your parents don't believe in? You know, growing up, I always wanted to be a broadway star. Unfortunately, nobody liked any of my musical ideas.
                    "Vengeful Ants Working at a Bachelor Party Plan World Domination: The Musical" never took off. Maybe one day... You know 
                    my back up life path was always going to clown college. My father hates clowns and I think about becoming a clown just to spite him.
                    But, now that I really think about, I just don't think my heart is in the right place to become a clown. I have a lot of respect for the art and 
                    I don't think I should be bringing such a negative energy to the craft.

                    And who actually cared enough to do the math and write the code for this?

                    Meet Chistine. She is a full-time, professional nerd. Thank you Christine for believing in my stupid ideas teehee.
                    It did take a lot of time and money convincing Christine to do this for me. She would only agree if I paid her
                    1 million dollars, 700 melons, and an eleven minute, personalized audio recording of pre-written, nightly affirmations. 
                    I might have issues with hiring people that my company cannot afford. The truth is we cannot afford anything. Our offices are freezing because
                    the <em>Yoga Ball Door&trade;</em> let out all of the warm air in the winter time. I am shivering aggresively as I type this.
                    Not only that, but all of our <em>Forks with Spinning Prongs&trade;</em> exploded, setting our kitchen and food supplies on fire.
                    Now we barely have anything to eat. The only things that keeps us remotely warm are our overheating computers.
